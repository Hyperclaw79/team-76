# **ELECTON**
Electon allows registered users to cast their votes as well as nominate themselves for any topic of discussion, image or idea. Our Administrators will initiate and moderate the elections.
Our users can upload text or media and allow other users to cast their votes on it. The results of every “election” will be displayed at the end of the time-limit.
This inludes both web and mobile interfaces of our application. Currently this application is running on cluster **fortune22** hosted by Hasura.


## **How it works?**
Admin can start an election like "Who's got the best selfie?" and anyone can nominate themselves with a valid selfie of theirs within a nomination deadline. After nomination deadline, the voting process starts and anyone can vote till the voting deadline. After said deadline the ultimate result will be displayed. After this the nominees are free to compete in other elections. A nominee in one election cannot nominate himself for any other election until the former is finished.

## **Overview**
We will have a 4 screen plan:

1. Login Form: We have used Hasura's authentication API and authentication kit. We have also modified said authentication kit with custom color theme.
2. A Listing of all currently running events. This will be called the **Vote** screen, where registered users can upvote their desired candidates.
3. A dynamically **Nominate** screen created page for each event which will initially include a submission form.
4. A dynamically created **Results** page for each event. Dynamically created meaning, it will basically be a template page which will be filled with details obtained throughout the event. This will ensure uniformity.


## **How is it built?**
#### **For the mobile interface-**
- The front-end is built using **React Native** 
- The Authentication pages are built using pure React Native. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. Those building blocks are put together using JavaScript and React. This also uses an open source module tcomb-form-native for the forms, wrapped around Hasura's Auth API. The main app is divided into several screens and each of them are linked into the Navigation chain, using React Navigation. 
#### **For the web interface-**
- The front-end of the web application using React. React (sometimes styled React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook, Instagram and a community of individual developers and corporations. This coupled with Material-UI (React Components that Implement Google's Material Design) make up the core of our front-end development. This uses Hasura's Auth API. We have used tab-based navigation. 
#### **Back-end-**
- The backend development has been done using Flask. Flask is a micro web framework written in Python and based on the Werkzeug toolkit and Jinja2 template engine.

## **How to Run?**
#### **For the Mobile Interface-**
- `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start -- --reset-cache
# or
yarn start -- --reset-cache
```

- `npm run ios`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

- `npm run android`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup). We also recommend installing Genymotion as your Android emulator. Once you've finished setting up the native build environment, there are two options for making the right copy of `adb` available to Create React Native App:

- Using Android Studio's `adb`

1. Make sure that you can run adb from your terminal.
2. Open Genymotion and navigate to `Settings -> ADB`. Select “Use custom Android SDK tools” and update with your [Android SDK directory](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25176594/android-sdk-location).

- Using Genymotion's `adb`

1. Find Genymotion’s copy of adb. On macOS for example, this is normally `/Applications/Genymotion.app/Contents/MacOS/tools/`.
2. Add the Genymotion tools directory to your path (instructions for [Mac](http://osxdaily.com/2014/08/14/add-new-path-to-path-command-line/), [Linux](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001647.htm), and [Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/)).
3. Make sure that you can run adb from your terminal.

#### **For the web interface-**
- After you clone or download the files onto your system. `cd` into the required directory from your **command line**.
- Then run `npm install` to take care of the required dependencies and files required to run this application.
- Then run `create-react-app`.
- After this run `npm start`. You should see **Electon** up and running in your default browser promptly.
- Add `npm run build` && `npm i serve && serve -s build` for optimized build.
